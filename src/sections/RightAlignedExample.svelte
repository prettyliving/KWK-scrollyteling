                Here's an example chart using
                <a href="https://www.highcharts.com/">Highcharts</a>!
            </p>
            <p>
                Highcharts is a super-flexible library for creating all kinds of
                charts. See demos of different chart types <a
                    href="https://www.highcharts.com/demo">here</a
                >.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since we're using Highcharts through Svelte, the syntax is a
                little different from what you might see in the demos. But all
                of Highcharts' functionality is available through the Highcharts
                for Svelte package. The configuration is done through the
                <code>options</code> json object passed to the chart, which you'll
                see in the source code for this template.
            </p>
            <p>
                Use the
                <a href="https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/"
                    >API reference</a
                >
                to understand what each element in the <code>options</code> object
                does.

                Welcome to the KWK Data Scrollytelling Template!
            </ArticleText>

            <ArticleText>
                This is a basic example of how you might create a scrollytelling
                piece using Svelte and Highcharts.
            </ArticleText>

            <ArticleText>
                You can use this template as a starting point for your project.
                Or, if you want to build something from scratch, you can use it
                as a reference for specific functionality.
            </ArticleText>

            <ArticleText>
                This is just one way that scrollytelling can look. If you use
                this template, be sure to modify it and make it your own!
